1. Write a sketch in which two sprites are drawn using functions. One sprite is a character (such as Mario) and the other is an item (such as coin). You should be able to move the character using the arrow keys. The item sprite should spawn randomly and the goal will be to move the character to get the item. When the character gets the item, you make the character animate.

2. Add to the previous script where the item disappears after the character gets it.

3. Spawn the item 5 items randomly until the character gets them all.


I used my Jason mask sprite from assignment 3 as my character, and a knife as my item. I was able to get my sprite to move upon command of the arrow keys as asked. I was also able to randomize the spawn position of my knife upon refresh. I had started the process of making the if/else function to make my knife dissapear upon collision, but didnt make it that far unfortunately. I was also planning on spawning a new knife when the original had dissapeared, until five knifes were collected. I was also going to make it so that the jason mask would turn red upon collision of the knives, just for the first second when the collision would occur.
